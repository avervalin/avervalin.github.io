    <h1>Spring into Another Beautiful Season</h1>

    <p><img src="spring-tree.png" alt="Spring" title="Spring" class="tree">Spring is the season after winter and before summer. Days become longer and weather gets warmer in the temperate zone because the Earth tilts relative to its orbital plane around the Sun. In many parts of the world it rains for hours. This helps the plants grow and flowers bloom.</p>
    <p>The last season of the year is spring. This season is very short-lived. It comes in the middle of February. It is replaced by summer in the middle of March. Yet it is one of the best seasons of the year. Spring is called ‘the king of the season’ for its natural beauty. It is a very pleasant season, neither very cold nor warm. The sky is clear and blue. A gentle breeze blows in the morning and in the afternoon. Nature wears a new look. New leaves shoot out from bare branches of trees and plants. The main attraction of this season is the song of the cuckoo. It is the season of fruits and flowers. Palas blooms in the forest. This flower is very beautiful to look at. Vegetables grow in plenty. Spring gives inspiration to the poets. A large number of poems have been written in various languages during this season.</p>
