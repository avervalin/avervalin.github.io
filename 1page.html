    <p>Burger King's first rebrand in 20 years focuses on the American fast-food restaurant's food and its past says its designer Lisa Smith, executive creative director at Jones Knowles Ritchie.
      The comprehensive redesign of Burger King's visual identity by Jones Knowles Ritchie included the creation of a retro logo that closely resembles the logo used by the brand in the 1970s, 80s and 90s.</p>
    <p>"We explored a lot of different design territories, but kept coming back to the brand's original iconic logo from 1969 and 1994 when Burger King looked at its best," Smith told Dezeen.</p>
    <p>"We were inspired by how it has grown to have such an iconic place in culture – from Back to the Future, Gremlins through to more recently Stranger Things and BK’s Warhol campaign," she continued. "The new logo pays homage to the brand's heritage with a refined design that's confident, simple and fun."</p>
    <p>Alongside the retro logo, Jones Knowles Ritchie revamped the restaurant's packaging, uniforms, merchandising, menu boards, restaurant signage and marketing assets. All elements of the design, from the colour palette to the custom typeface called Flame Sans, were derived from the food.</p>
