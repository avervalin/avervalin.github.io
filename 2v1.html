    <h1>Three Website Opinion Article: Two Good, One Bad</h1>

    <h2><a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">FaceBook Sign-in Page</a></h2>
    <h4>Review: Good</h5>
    <p>I chose to review Facebook’s login page because I expected for it to be cluttered with either unnecessary imagery or some sort of advertisement(s). However, I quickly noticed that was not the reality of the situation. Despite just being a page for a login screen, Facebook’s stood out from the norm solely due to its simplistic style; void of any distraction. To give you an idea: the color pallet used is simple, but effective at being pleasant; the majority of the page’s color use consisting of a light gray background. However, the iconic use of ‘<i>Facebook blue</i>’ is included to highlight the Facebook banner as well as the “login” / “add account” buttons.</p>
    <p>Moreover, in terms of the aesthetically pleasing style of the page’s actual layout, the only ‘busy’ part of the whole page is the footer section. While crowded compared to the rest of the page, in reality, the text in this section neatly mentions Facebook’s partners, products, language options, and online services — despite the many options. Overall, the page is laid out quite nicely and seems to adjust to fit any screen size very well due to is simplicity. If you are viewing the page in full screen, there are <i>two sections</i> of relevant navigation. On the left side of the screen, a “Recent logins” section, just below the Facebook header; then, on the right side of the screen, a manual log in section. However, if you view the page as half the screen or a smaller dimension such as a phone, the once separated sections become organized into a single column with the Facebook banner at the top, followed by the “Recent logins” section, and finally the manual log in section. Something I appreciated was how well coded the Facebook banner in the header was in order to complement the page’s aesthetic regardless of size (one column style vs. two column style.</p>
    <p>Finally, onto the webpage’s coding. The Facebook login page is, understandably, coded very simply and neat. From what I could tell, it seems to not have an issue with current HTML5 script. When I used W3’s <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:bold">Markup Validation Service</a> to check this website, I only noticed 8 errors. These included: 1 unnecessary use of the <i>type</i> attribute for JavaScript resources, 2 instances of a bad value used with a certain attribute/element pair, 2 incorrect <i>img</i> elements given improper/lacking use of an <i>alt</i> attribute, and 3 instances where the attribute <i>ajaxify</i> should not have been included on element <i>a</i>. While admittedly an easy target to call a well made website due to its simplicity, I find that simplicity to be fairly unique or at least aesthetically pleasing.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://bluemousetheatre.com/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">Blue Mouse Theater</a></h2>
    <h4>Review: Bad</h5>
    <p>The Blue Mouse Theater is a single screen movie theater near where I grew up in Tacoma, WA. I chose to review their homepage because I remembered it was not necessarily the best-looking website on the internet. To begin with, the webpage has a header section containing revolving images. In my opinion, these images change rather fast; which creates a feeling of being rushed and uncomfortable. Furthermore, when adjusting the browser size, some of the images will not fill the header section; possibly, if they are not uniformly sized or if they were not coded properly to adjust for screen size (without refreshing the page). On top of this, when adjusting the screen size, the navigation options often times do not adjust correctly either. Resulting in some options being entirely or partially covered and/or no longer remaining in a line. Additionally, the text goes from white to a magenta when highlighted making it fairly hard to see against the navy-gray background. Moreover, when scrolling down the site, the navigation section does not follow on the top of the page; however, it is not necessarily necessary given the <i>relatively</i> short length of the website’s pages.</p>
    <p>For the most part, there are three main columns in the body of this webpage. From left to right, the first column contains information on when the theater is open for showings as well as when their regular but limited showings of The Rocky Horror Picture Show are planned. The second and center column is much larger than the ones on either side as it contains information on the upcoming movie being shown at the theater. Additionally, this center column contains information on many specialized upcoming events. Finally, the third column on the right side of the page contains their social media information and some branded merchandise for sale. Aside from the third column, these are incredibly crowded and hard to keep your eyes focused on for a while; in part due to the use of multiple, font colors, font sizes, and pictures. The first column also contains an image at the top used to frame the column, but it jets up into the navigation section sloppily covering part of the options. Furthermore, not as bad in the first column as the second, there is a noticeable lack of spacing between text/sections making everything much harder to focus on and read easily across the webpage. Ironically, I find that there is too much spacing at the very top of center column before the text begins.</p>
    <p>One partially saving grace for the Blue Mouse Theater’s webpage was the color pallet they used. I found it to be both fitting to the actual atmosphere at the theater as well as aesthetically pleasing for the most part. However, when it comes to their choice of font colors for certain text, some did not mesh well with the website’s aesthetic. Most notably, their section giving information on <i>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</i> is styled in bright red to match the aesthetic of the film poster; however, it horribly clashes with the navy tones, various brighter shades of blue, and the magenta-esk highlights the webpage’s aesthetic as a whole consists of. Less notably, but still a frustrating color clash, is from the text in the center column that is styled to follow the magenta highlights of the page. However, it is glaringly apparent that there was not an attempt made to color match the magenta shade used on other parts of the website when styling said sections text. While the alternating text colors in the center column do serve useful for separating information, the multitude of pictures as you scroll away from the top — from various movies with their own color pallets — break the entire page’s aesthetic and makes it look sloppy/unplanned.</p>
    <p>Finally, in terms of the webpage’s coding, the Blue Mouse Theater homepage is coded decently for the most part. However, most of their lines of code individually contain several to-be referenced links; one after the other. From what I could tell, despite how messy the code appears, it seems to be up to par with current HTML5 script. When I used W3’s <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:bold">Markup Validation Service</a> to check this website, I noticed about 30 errors. For the most part, these errors regarded the confusing decision to use the h1 element across the page rather than only for top-level heading, a lack of including an alt attribute within all of the img elements on the page, as well as unproperly setting img sizes and locations on the page. Aside from that, there is one error from leaving an h2 element empty, one line lacks a paragraph element at the beginning (<.p>) despite containing a <./p> tag at the end, some improper nesting, and an unnecessary use of frameborder in one section as it is an obsolete command. Honestly, this page is far from the best website in terms of looks/coding — but also definetly not the worst!</p>

    <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">Wikipedia Homepage</a></h2>
    <h4>Review: Good</h5>
    <p>I’m glad I randomly chose to review The Wikipedia homepage beacuse it is coded well and not horribly confusing despite how much there seems to be on the page. From what I could tell, it seems to be up to par with current HTML5 script. When I used W3’s <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:bold">Markup Validation Service</a> to check this website, I noticed about 20 errors – a majority of which regard the unnecessary use of <i>navigation</i> as a <i>role</i> within the element <i>nav</i>. Aside from this, other errors included: several instances where element <i>style</i> is not allowed to be set as the child of the element <i>div</i> in certain contexts, but not all; a few instances of bad values used within certain attribute/element pairs; a couple instances when the attribute <i>icon</i> should not have been included on element <i>a</i>; and a couple <i>input</i> elements that lack proper use of <i>true</i> values.</p>
    <p>Moreover, in terms of Wikipedia’s homepage’s layout, there are two main navigation sections; along with a hundreds of other navigation links scattered across the page. Navigating on this page is slightly slow but not horribly bad. Interestingly, there is not much of a defined or remarkable header on this page. However, the footer is surprisingly ‘full’ of text regarding Wikipedia’s terms of use and brief trademark information, among some other things. Aside from these relatively more minor sections, the webpage consists primarily of a righthand column that displays Wikipedia’s navigation, various tools, a section mentioning their partners, and the page’s language options; a small navigation section for subject specific content near the top of the page; and, a large main section in the middle containing two main columns of various information (one softly shaded green, the other softly shaded blue) as well as a wide section at the bottom (soft purple) for a daily picture.</p>
    <p>Speaking of these colored sections, to further explain, the color pallet used by Wikipedia is moderately simple; consisting of grays, medium shades of blue, a column in the main section softly shaded green, and a small section at the bottom styled with a soft violet purple color. All of the text included on the page is either styled with the standard browser color for on-screen text or a medium shade of blue. Interestingly and fitting to the aesthetic, depending on the text-decoration used – none, italicized, or bold – the affected text will appear as a lighter shade of blue when no text-decoration is used or it’s italicized and a darker shade when in bold. Furthermore, despite having what would normally be an overwhelming amount information on a single webpage, regardless of separation by sections, the color pallet used to section off individual areas of text allows for an easy viewing of the page. This is quite a surprise given the fact that at first glance, all of the text on Wikipedia’s homepage would be assumably hard to follow; especially given the size 10.5 font. However, it is quickly noticeable that the page is organized well and quite easy to read.</p>
