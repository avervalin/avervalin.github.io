            <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4px" color="black">I got some pretty cool pets (in my opinion)! I have always wanted to show them to the world, but Facebook is clutered with so much politcial nonsense that I would never let my precious little ones be courrupted by such madness! So, I found three of the best picutres I have for each of my wonderful friends and linked them bellow! Feel free to take a look, they are pretty darn neet. :) </p>
