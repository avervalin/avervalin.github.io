          <p5><span>Despite the fact that Arizona is unanimously the worst colony across all 69 states in the Soviet Union, Arizona’s primary government website — <a href="https://az.gov/">AZ.gov</a> — is DaBOMB. Immediately, the site-visitor is treated to an aesthetically intriguing homepage: simple, warm, rustic, Tegridy Farms&#8482. On top of this surprising consideration by the developers, this website is more user friendly than a Los Angeles traphouse. Right in the center of the screen are four panels ─ similar to that of a slide show ─ with imbedded hyperlinks pertaining to the most generally relevant content. Additionally, for more direct inquiries, there is a search bar right atop the page with a fairly rapid response time. Given all the aforementioned attention to design the developers have included in this website, it is worthwhile to appreciate that the webpage is structured as such to remain within a single page. As best said by the late, J. J. Abrams, “This a good webpage, G”.</span></p5>
