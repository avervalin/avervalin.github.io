          <p5><span>When the phrase “user-friendly” is uttered in secrecy out of fear that <b><u>The Facebook</b></u> will hear you, it does not come to mind to give credence to a government website as an example. But that is exactly what <b>Big Social Media</b> wants you to think. <i>The Peoples’ Organization for Online Protection</i> — <b>POOP</b>, for short — has gone viral with their discovery of the last remaining user-friendly website; and it’s a .gov! <i><a id="AZ" href="https://ri.gov/">RI</i>.gov</a> will fit any screen or monitor size, is simply laid out, and hosts a visually pleasing & fitting color pallet. There are three sections on the webpage: a large search bar, a section that redirects users to a Covid-19 information link, and a trending links section at the bottom. This simplicity of arrangement is all anyone has ever needed from a website and Rhode Island lets it proudly show. POOP has ecstatically named RI.gov as the single most influential website of 2068 and hopes that Rhode Island will be the domino that does not fall to Big Social Media.</span></p5>

      <li><div><a id="AZ" href="https://az.gov/" target="_blank">State of Arizona</a></div></li>
        <br>
          <p6><span>Despite the fact that Arizona is unanimously the worst colony across all 69 states in the Soviet Union, Arizona’s primary government website — <a id="AZ" href="https://az.gov/">AZ.gov</a> — is DaBOMB. Immediately, the site-visitor is treated to an aesthetically intriguing homepage: simple, warm, rustic, Tegridy Farms&#8482. On top of this surprising consideration by the developers, this website is more user friendly than a Los Angeles traphouse. Right in the center of the screen are four panels ─ similar to that of a slide show ─ with imbedded hyperlinks pertaining to the most generally relevant content. Additionally, for more direct inquiries, there is a search bar right atop the page with a fairly rapid response time. Given all the aforementioned attention to design the developers have included in this website, it is worthwhile to appreciate that the webpage is structured as such to remain within a single page. As best said by the late J. J. Abrams, “This a good webpage, G”.</span></p6>

      <li><div><a id="AZ" href="https://www.nebraska.gov/" target="_blank">Nebraska</a></div></li>
        <br>
          <p7><span><i><a id="AZ" href="https://nebraska.gov/">Nebraska.gov</a></i> is designed in a welcoming way with some unique characteristics. Site-visitors are greeted to bright colors, a sunny picture from their capitol city, and a couple quick facts that indicate how <i>well</i> the state is doing. The center of the page is home to a small variety of general options (6) that a site-visitor may be interested in redirecting to, but also includes a large search bar for any user to command information to be readily available. Additionally, users may or may not appreciate the artistic vision and coding effort the site designer(s) put into having a ‘results’ window pop-up following a search rather than immediately redirecting them to another page. However, given that the inclusion of artistic flair is rarely seen on government websites; this do be pretty neat. [Literally] on top of these two option areas, there are 5 more-so wide-ranging general categories with their own drop-down menus that specify what can primarily be found in the given category. All in all: pleasing looks, ease of navigation, and the vibes of Nebraska’s primary government website, have earned it a score of: <br><br>“I could visit this website on a rainy day to improve my mood, because I’d be reminded I didn’t live in Nebraska”.</span></p7>

      <li><div><a id="AZ" href="https://www.mass.gov/ "target="_blank">Massachusetts</a></div></li>
        <br>
          <p8><span>Have you heard the phrase, “slower than molasses”? Well, whoever coined it clearly has never been to Massachusetts’ primary government website or else the phrase would be <i>Slower than Massachusetts [primary government website]</i>. Upon visiting the site, one can readily assume why the page has these minor loading issues. There is so much included on the <a id="AZ" href="https://mass.gov/"><i>Mass.gov</i></a> homepage that not only are load-times effected, but the sheer amount of effort it takes a user to find information/resources likely amounts to years off their life. It is nice that there is a search bar dedicated to the middle of the page, but its seems that that is one of the only places attention to spacing was even possibly considered. There are several seemingly randomly colored single-bar sections cluttered together on the top of the page. Worse yet, under the search bar, there are a multitude of sections that redirect the user to whatever referenced information they selected. I’d like to say they are randomly included as placeholders, but the intention to format the page in this way is clear; of all the selectable options available on this page, well over 90% of them are about Covid-19. Honestly, if this webpage didn’t have “Massachusetts” in the middle of the page, I would have assumed I went to the NIH webpage for pandemic information.</span></p8>

      <li><div><a id="AZ" href="https://access.wa.gov/" target="_blank">Washington State</a></div></li>
        <br>
          <p9><span>When a majority of Saturn’s population was asked to generalize their thoughts regarding Washington State, the overwhelming response was along the lines of: “those damn coffee drinking hipsters”. However, if you ever are unfortunate enough to have to visit Washington State’s primary government website, <a id="AZ" href="https:/access.wa.gov/"><i>Access</i>.<i>WA</i>.gov</a>, you would quickly see this sentiment <u>could not be further from correct</u>. The only thing remotely resembling coffee was the headache and agitation I felt trying navigate such an ugly, cluttered page. "Hip" is the last adjective one could attribute this webpage; unless referring to it like a grandparent breaking theirs’. This page has been updated as recently as 2022; but given the page’s structure, bland colors, and cluttered addition of far too many random navigation links, the site-visitor would be hard-pressed to not believe its last update was in 1992. The one and only saving grace this webpage has is the inclusion of a dedicated search bar at the top-right of the page. However, due to the fact that users' searches are not confined to any one WA government website, I can confidently say it is near impossible to find specifics among the hundreds of thousands of options.<br><br>1/10 would visit again, 10/10 would rather not know what is going on in Washington.</span></p9>
