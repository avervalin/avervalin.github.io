        <p><img src="burger.png" alt="Burger" title="Amazing Eats!" class="burger">Burger King was founded in 1953 in Jacksonville, Florida, as Insta-Burger King by Keith J. Kramer and his wife's uncle, Matthew Burns. Their first stores were centered around a piece of equipment known as the Insta-Broiler, which was very effective at cooking burgers.</p>
        <p>Texas Pacific Group introduced the Whopper Bar concept, allowing customers in some stores to better see the burgers being made, a concept similar to the Benihana steakhouse chain but more familiar to Starbucks customers, with the workers being named "Whopperistas." The company grew to be worth $3.2 billion, the purchase price that 3G Capital paid TPG for it in 2010.</p>
        <p>As of 2018, Burger King has reclaimed the second spot in the burger wars with $9.6 billion in U.S. sales when compared to $9.3 billion in sales for Wendy's for the previous year. McDonaldâ€™s is still the leader with $37.6 billion in U.S. sales.</p>
        <p>Burger King's stock, which trades under Restaurant Brands, has gone from $35 in 2014 to $55 as of 2018 or 57%.</p>
